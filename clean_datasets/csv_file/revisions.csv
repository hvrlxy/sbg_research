1,75683,2021-02-08 11:45:00,1,In the first question I accidentally did an exponent of 2 instead of 3 and for the 3rd question I had -2/3 instead of just having -2,I will make sure I have the problem right and then I will go to office hour to get a better understanding of graphing,Yes,Sp21 - 001

3,46516,2021-02-10 16:21:00,1,"I thought the question said we could either explain whether the average velocity was two, or make any function for the formula where the average velocity from [-1,1] was not 2. I wasn't aware that we had to prove it was right. So instead of proving it right, I made up a random function where the average velocity from [-1,1] did not equal 2.","I understand how to do the material, I think that I just had a misunderstanding with the question.",No,Sp21 - 001
4,36585,2021-02-12 17:29:00,1,I misunderstood the last question of the check point and forgot that the slope of the line is equal to the average velocity between the interval.

20,18832,2021-02-19 08:41:00,1,"When I was doing checkpoint 1, I misunderstood the concept of the average rate of change. An average rate of change of 1 at one point and 3 and other point do not necessarily result in an average of 2, it's contingent on the actual points at which they're at, because the rate of change at those particular instances doesn't necessarily represent the rate of change of the points around them to much.","I'd like help understanding the rate of change over intervals of time, specifically more so when I have two rates of change over two separate points and I need to find an average rate of change between the two of them. I will be attending Dr. Ford's office hours, as well as re-reading the material and focusing more on the problems.

24,15531,2021-02-15 15:32:00,1,My misunderstanding came from not fully thinking through the problem. i was only thinking about two points on a curved line and didn't think about a function that could have a gap between the lines.,After reading through the feedback as i was able to go back to the book at figure out where i went wrong.,No,Sp21 - 001

28,58850,2021-03-01 22:42:00,2,"The numbers that I used in the table needed to be smaller for me to able to get a more accurate value.

29,62252,2021-04-02 20:30:00,2,"I made the mistake of saying the limit of f(x) at the point x=0 is 1, when the value at that point does not exist because both lines go through x=0.

39,26815,2021-04-26 10:17:00,3,"I tried to reattempt it, but I did not include a limit in the limit definition when getting the solution.

41,18832,2021-04-27 14:23:00,3,"The main misunderstanding I had was the use of the limit definition.

51,31085,2021-04-20 13:28:00,3,I made an algebra mistake is what I was told but looking back on it I think I understand more of what I am looking at. I put everything inside the parenthesis when I should have left out the 3 and then plugged in (x+g) to get (3(-3+h)-5)-[3(-3)-5] all over h then finished computing from there you end up with the a lim at the point x=-3 is 3,I prepared by watching the videos available on Moodle I did not do that the first time.

 (4) I mixed the idea that temperature is equal to the function of f(q) which means that Temperature will change because it is dependent on the change of the function.
