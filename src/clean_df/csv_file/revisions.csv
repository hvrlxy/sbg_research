3,46516,2021-02-10 16:21:00,1,1,"I thought the question said we could either explain whether the average velocity was two, or make any function for the formula where the average velocity from [-1,1] was not 2. I wasn't aware that we had to prove it was right. So instead of proving it right, I made up a random function where the average velocity from [-1,1] did not equal 2.","I understand how to do the material, I think that I just had a misunderstanding with the question.",No,Sp21 - 001
4,36585,2021-02-12 17:29:00,1,1,I misunderstood the last question of the check point and forgot that the slope of the line is equal to the average velocity between the interval.

20,18832,2021-02-19 08:41:00,1,1,"When I was doing checkpoint 1, I misunderstood the concept of the average rate of change. An average rate of change of 1 at one point and 3 and other point do not necessarily result in an average of 2, it's contingent on the actual points at which they're at, because the rate of change at those particular instances doesn't necessarily represent the rate of change of the points around them to much.","I'd like help understanding the rate of change over intervals of time, specifically more so when I have two rates of change over two separate points and I need to find an average rate of change between the two of them. I will be attending Dr. Ford's office hours, as well as re-reading the material and focusing more on the problems. I know that I understand how to do the math, I just have difficulty grasping the concept of why I'm doing the math, or why I need to take certain steps.",Yes,Sp21 - 001
21,99444,2021-02-19 12:29:00,1,1,"I misunderstood how to utilize the graph in part B in order to solve the problem.

24,15531,2021-02-15 15:32:00,1,1,My misunderstanding came from not fully thinking through the problem. i was only thinking about two points on a curved line and didn't think about a function that could have a gap between the lines.,After reading through the feedback as i was able to go back to the book at figure out where i went wrong.,No,Sp21 - 001

29,62252,2021-04-02 20:30:00,1,2,"I made the mistake of saying the limit of f(x) at the point x=0 is 1, when the value at that point does not exist because both lines go through x=0. I also made the mistake of drawing the graph where lim x-->0 f(x) and f(0) agree, rather than disagree.","I will make sure to understand that if two point are under the same x-value, than the limit of that value does not exist.

39,26815,2021-04-26 10:17:00,1,3,"I tried to reattempt it, but I did not include a limit in the limit definition when getting the solution.

 (4) I mixed the idea that temperature is equal to the function of f(q) which means that Temperature will change because it is dependent on the change of the function.
 (6) I did not really understand that a function of xis continuous at x=a if f has a limit as x approaches a and is equal to its function value at x=a and that the function of f(x)=f(a) as the limit of f approaches x
 (11) I wasn't familiarized with the derivative of log_a(x) (which=1/xlna) and the tangent (= sec^2)
 (12) I found the slope but forgot to plug it back in to determine the equation of the tangent line
 (13)I forgot that the derivative of a constant being added or subtracted to x is 0, which gave me the wrong denominator and I should have written the second limit as a quotient by writing it as a positive exponent instead.","For each of the attempts I will make sure to run through the ""cheat"" sheets and rewatch the videos attached to Moodle to make sure I understand each of these checkpoints correctly.
